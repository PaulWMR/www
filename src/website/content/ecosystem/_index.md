description: Introduction to the http4k ecosystem
---

The http4k Ecosystem exists as a number of sub-ecosystems, each with its own focus and set of modules, and each designed with a philosophy of simplicity and efficiency. These modules are lightweight, with minimal dependencies, ensuring that you only pull in what you need. This makes it ideal for those seeking fine-grained control over their dependencies while keeping the overall application size manageable. This modular nature enables developers to build applications incrementally, integrating only the required components without unnecessary bloat.

As per our ethos, another core principle of the http4k ecosystem is its test-first approach. Each module is crafted to be fully testable without needing external infrastructure, empowering developers to create reliable, well-tested applications from the outset. This focus on testing at all levels makes http4k particularly well-suited for environments where code quality and reliability are paramount.
