description: Introduction to the http4k ecosystem
---

The http4k Ecosystem exists as a number of sub-ecosystems, each with its own focus and set of modules. The core ecosystem is the foundation of the http4k project, providing the essential building blocks for creating HTTP servers and clients. This ecosystem is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and testable, making it ideal for building reliable, high-performance applications.
http4k offers a robust ecosystems consisting of approximately 80 modules, each designed with a philosophy of minimalism and efficiency. These modules are lightweight, with minimal dependencies, ensuring that you only pull in what you need. This makes it ideal for those seeking fine-grained control over their dependencies while keeping the overall application size manageable. The ecosystem’s modular nature enables developers to build applications incrementally, integrating only the required components without unnecessary bloat.

A core principle of the http4k ecosystem is its test-first approach. Each module is crafted to be fully testable without needing external infrastructure, empowering developers to create reliable, well-tested applications from the outset. This focus on testing at all levels makes http4k particularly well-suited for environments where code quality and reliability are paramount.

Whether you’re looking to integrate HTTP servers, clients, or specific libraries, http4k’s small, efficient modules are designed to plug seamlessly into your project, giving you flexibility without sacrificing performance or testability.s
