## http4k EE Timeline

The timeline for http4k EE's LTS has been designed to strike a balance between a generous open source period and the need for us to take advantage for new language features available in the JDK. We are also commited to providing support using a predictable timeline for our LTS customers, which is synchronized with the official JDK release and support cycle of LTS versions (currently every 2 years), but offset by a 3 month window. To put that more visually, this is the timeline for current and future Java LTS releases:

{{< timeline data="Java" >}}

Based on the above, the current plan is for future major http4k versions to have the following Community and Enterprise Edition (LTS) schedule:

{{< timeline data="http4k" >}}

In the case of an intermediate major version upgrade between JDK versions, the previous major version will also immediate start a 24 month support window to ensure that customers have a smooth upgrade path. 

If you have any questions about the http4k EE subscription, or long-term support requirements outside of the above schedule, please get in touch using the below contact link and we will endeavour to assist.
