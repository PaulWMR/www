The **http4k** project is a culmination of work on real-world projects in many different industries. Whilst the library is designed to be simple to learn and use, there are many advantages to learning from our mistakes when using it! To this end, the  team have developed a significant amount of training materials which can be used to give teams new to **http4k** the best possible start, especially around the following areas:

- **Advanced testing strategies** for individual and entire fleets of services.
- **Building, packaging and deploying** http4k apps to on-premises and cloud-based environments.
- Advanced **CI/CD design**.
- **Extending** the http4k libraries.
- Configuration of http4k apps for use in **data-sensitive environments** (customer PII protection etc).

These materials can be delivered both remotely and in on-site sessions. If you are interested in taking advantage of our mistakes, please get in touch.
